# About Me

## Who's a Burhan?

Believe it or not, that's my first name. Funny enough, it means "proof" or "evidence" which I didn't think was very cool when I was younger, but eventually grew into.

## What am I doing?

Right now (as of early 2025) I'm working in machine learning and software development. I transitioned into machine learning, specifically computer vision, near the end of 2022 and really have been enjoying it ever since.

## How did I get here?

A long and circuitous path. Maybe I'll map out a timeline sometime in the near future.

## Where have I been?

Geographically I've been to a few places, mostly in the US but I've also enjoyed my fair share of international travel. It's always challenging to find a good balance between responsibilities and frivolous travel, but I'm hoping to work more of the latter into my life in the near future.

## What's next?

🚧 Currently under construction (I'm sure I'll figure it out someday) 🏗
