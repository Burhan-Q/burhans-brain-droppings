# The First Drop

Yeah, I decided to do this. Is it more special than anyone elses? Probably not. Doing it anyway in hopes that serves as a good example of what _not_ to do.

## Where does "brain droppings" come from?

I'm a big fan of [George Carlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin). I've looked up to him ever since I was a kid, and yes I listened to his standup as a kid, but not with permission (any surprise there?).

So in honor of one of the people I most admire, I "borrowed" the name from [his book of the same title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Droppings). If you know Carlin's standup, you probably know most of the content of the book, but it's still a fun read or listen.

!!! note

    I'm not claiming to be on par with Carlin's wit, humor, or intelligence; only celebrating his legacy.

## What to expect

Honestly I'm not sure. I've done a lot and have a lot of interests. Of course I will try to make the content posted here useful, but I can't promise anything.

A good place to see what I'm working on is my [GitHub](https://github.com/Burhan-Q) (link also in the footer). I'm fairly active on Discord, but you'll have to find one of the various communities I'm in as I generally don't reply to DMs. You can also reach out to me on LinkedIn if you want to connect, but make sure you mention the title of the book, otherwise I might not accept.
